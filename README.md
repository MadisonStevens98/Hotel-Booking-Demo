# Hotel-Booking-Demo

A C++ demo of a hotel reservation system. The demo takes a date (any int) from the user, and the program either makes a record under that date, or pulls up the existing record under that date. The demo then tells the user the total number of all rooms available, reserved, or open. It then opens a menu to allow user to make a reservation, check the total hotel revenue and room status, or change the date.

Meant to demonstrate an understanding of C++
